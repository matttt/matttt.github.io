Here's a new file with the 21 language files. I added seven lines at the end for each file, that have the following information:
1) "The Scale of the Universe"
2) "Use the scroll bar to zoom in and out."
3) "Click on objects to learn more."
4) "Start"
5) Translated by (translator's name)
6) The name of the language, in that language
7) The name of the language, in English

I added the last two, in case it makes stuff easier!
